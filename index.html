        Let me introduce ourselves. We're Adam and Jo, husband and wife team who have over the past year been furiously studying to be able to bring you our own created site. 
        We're nature lovers, tea drinkers, parents to an absolutley adorable terror and part-time students. 
        </p>
        <p class="third">We love that you visited and hope you come back soon again to see our progress</p>
